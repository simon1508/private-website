            For 4 years, I'm interested in Visual Effects and Video Editing. <br>


            Two years ago, I started to teach myself in the area of Video Editing and Visual Effects. I started with a few simple edits and got better and better.

            Through the practice with the program After Effects, I also learned the program Premiere Pro.

            Two years ago, I mastered more than the basics of After Effects and Premiere Pro.

            I started programming with the Visual Basic programming language four years ago. </br>

            A year later I learned C#, which I have been working with so far. With C# I got a lot of insights into the language and started working with WPF and Web-Pages.
            Furthermore, I own basic knowledge in the programming languages: PHP, Python and JavaScript

            Two years ago I started working with a website builder, a program that allows you to create your own website quickly, easily and with just a few clicks.


            A year later I started learning the markup language HTML and CSS to realize my first 100% self-made website. For 3 months I started learning the language JavaScript.
