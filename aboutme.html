            Since 4 years I'm interested in Visual Effects and Video Editing. <br>

            2 years ago I started to teach myself in the area of Video Editing and Visual Effects. I started with a few simple edits and got better and better. 

            Through the practise with the program After Effects I also learned the program Premiere Pro.

            For 2 years I have mastered more than the basics of After Effects and Premiere Pro.

            I started programming with the Visual Basics programming language four years ago. <br>

            A year later I learned C#, which I have been working with so far. With C# I got a lot of insights into the language and started working with WPF, WIN-Forms and Web-Pages.

            I've created several console programs like a calculator and a BMI calculator.

            I have also been learning the Java programming language for half a year.

            Two years ago I started to working with a website builder, a program that allows you to create your own website quickly, easily and with just a few clicks. <br>

            A year later I started learning the programing language HTML and CSS to realize my first 100% self-made website.
